Notes

Variables:
All variables in Java must be declared before they are used. A variable declaration includes a type for the variable, as well as a name (a valid identifier) for the variable. Here are some examples of variable declarations:
    int id;
    boolean isLoggedIn;
    float bankAccountBalance;

Variables are initialized when they are assigned a value:
    id = 123;
    isLoggedIn = false;
    bankAccountBalance = 1000.23;

Strings are objects not variables
